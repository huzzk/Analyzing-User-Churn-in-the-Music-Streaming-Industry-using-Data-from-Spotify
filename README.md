# Analyzing-User-Churn-in-the-Music-Streaming-Industry-using-Data-from-Spotify

This project aims to analyze user churn in the music streaming industry, using data from the popular Spotify platform. The objective is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies users who are likely to churn, enabling Spotify to take proactive measures to retain these users and increase customer loyalty. The dataset comprises 286500 rows and 18 columns, with critical predictors such as gender, level, location, method, and song. Preliminary data exploration suggests that paid subscribers tend to complete entire songs compared to free users, but have a higher churn rate. This project aims to explore churn rate in greater detail and identify the best machine learning algorithms to perform on this dataset, significant factors affecting churn, and essential features for predicting churn. The project will utilize tools such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data processing, analysis, and visualization, with a summary of key findings, methodology, and conclusions.
